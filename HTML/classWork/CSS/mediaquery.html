                In academic writing, most paragraphs include at least three sentences, though rarely more than ten.
                So, how many paragraphs are enough, and how many are too many? For historical writing, 
                for most academic paper in general there should be between four and six paragraphs in a two-page paper, or six and twelve in a five-page essay.

            <p class="para">There's no set number of lines for a paragraph, but a common guideline is to have 3-7 lines, which typically corresponds to 3-5 sentences,
                 depending on sentence length and formatting. Some consider one-sentence paragraphs acceptable for emphasis or in informal writing.
                  The key is to develop a single main idea within a paragraph, regardless of its length.
