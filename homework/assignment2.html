    <p style="color:black;background-color: blue;"> language is a basic knowledge you need to know to create websites.<br> It is quite simple and all the websites are using it. Advanced websites are using a few more languages together with HTML.</p>

    <h2 style="color:red;">Editor</h2>
    <p style="color:yellow;background-color: blueviolet;"> write a HTML code it's not a good idea to use a simple Notepad because it miss a lot of features like code highlighting or UTF encoding support.</p>

    <h2 style="color:red;">PsPad</h2>
    <p style="color:goldenrod;background-color: azure;"> the beginning webdesigners may use Notepad++ which is a really good editor</p>

    <h2 style="color:red;">HTML page</h2>
    <p style="color:brown;background-color: aqua;"> page can be created easily, basically it's just a text document.</p>

    <h2 style="color:red;">Tags</h2>
    <p style="color:chocolate;background-color: yellow;"> consists from marks (so-called tags). By itself it allows to give the elements on the page some meaning and this is it's main task. Firstly HTML was used for graphic styling of pages but the resulting websites were confusing so it has been limited just to web content.</p>
